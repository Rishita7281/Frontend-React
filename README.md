üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm or yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/medappoint.git
cd medappoint

(Note: Replace https://github.com/your-username/medappoint.git with your actual repository URL.)

Install dependencies:
Using npm:

npm install

Or using yarn:

yarn install

Tailwind CSS Setup (if not already configured):
Ensure your tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js are correctly set up and your index.css (or equivalent) includes the Tailwind directives. If you're building this from scratch, refer to the Tailwind CSS React guide.
For a quick local test (e.g., if you're directly opening an HTML file wrapping this React app), ensure you have the Tailwind CDN script in your index.html:

<!-- public/index.html -->
<head>
  <!-- ... other head elements ... -->
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>

Running the Application
Once dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

Using npm:

npm start

Or using yarn:

yarn start

This will open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another available port).

üí° Usage

‚è≠Ô∏è Future Enhancements

Advanced Search & Filters: More granular filtering options (e.g., by rating, distance, specific doctors).
